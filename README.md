### UPDATE - 2025-04-25

I have worked and made some progress on setting up the database layout and testing the modulated code with it.

However, I will be pausing this project in order to focus on different projects in different languages.

That being said, I may return to the project to continue on the work as the next step is to go for the UI, and test display of the tables aligning up.

To summarize:
- Completed
	- Basic Database Layout is completed.
	- Modulated Database Script has been shown to complement well with the requirements.
- To do
	- Graphical User Interface, using the modulated PyQt6 script for this.
	- Connecting the Database operations with the UI.

### For Newcomers

Invoice Registry is an PyQt5 with SQLite3 implementation based GUI-Application which allows a much organized storage of the invoices with payments, credit / debits notes, roles and log of who interacts with the application, and basic security features like an authenticator.

The project has a detail description within the "versions/" folder. There you will find a prior version folder named "1.1.15v/", which was used early on. You can check out the older version if you want to, there will be a README within the "1.1.15v/" folder to guide you with the basics of the application.
